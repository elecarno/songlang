Some words have variations that are *feminine connotative* or *masculine connotative*. Other than this, words are presumed to be neutral.

Negative Suffix: "-ala", if there is/are vowels at the end of the word, they are removed until the suffix is able to be placed after a consonant, e.g: [[kalne]]

Words should be "optimistic". The positive word for a concept comes first, and the negative antonym is derived *from* it.
