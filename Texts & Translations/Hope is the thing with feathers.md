#translation

“Hope” is the thing with feathers
That perches in the soul
And sings the tune without the words
And never stops - at all

And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard
And sore must be the storm
That could abash the little Bird
That kept so many warm

I’ve heard it in the chillest land
And on the strangest Sea
Yet - never - in Extremity,
It asked a crumb - of me.

"Iato" imyu kate ain laibre ezerano
wynya imyu zaraye yaitano
ade imyu maiko lin imyu raenre
ade linte kitano.

Ade - wynya imyu wytakalo - limeralo ezerano rume
ade imyu wyzea, taka ito ezerano
lint imyu aloando ikele abidyzo tazano
lint kuandalo yentre lirie idale yato.
